# Reader contacts with the H3 tail

There are four scripts, one for each bound reader system. They are written for use with the trajectories uploaded to Zenodo from this work.

They will use MDAnalysis to calculate contacts between each H3 tail residue and the reader.

To use, navigate to the corresponding simulation directories and execute each python script with its corresponding system.

This will generate folders and files corresponding to the prefix of the trajectories.
